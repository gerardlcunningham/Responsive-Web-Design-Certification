            <article>
                <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of
                    elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a
                    certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to
                    somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example,
                    take the following line of content:</p>
                <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
                <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in
                    paragraph tags:</p>
                <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code><br>
                <h1>Anatomy of an HTML element</h1>
                <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
                <p><img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png"
                        class="image"></p>
                <p>The main parts are as follows:
                <ol>
                    <li><b>The opening tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening
                        and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in
                        this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
                    <li><b>The closing tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash
                        before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph
                        ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to
                        strange results.</li>
                    <li><b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
                    <li><b>The element:</b> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</p>
                <p><img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png"
                        class="image">
                </p>
                <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual
                    content. Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class
                    attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and
                    any other elements with the same class value) with style information and other things. Some
                    attributes have no value, such as required.</p>
                <p>Attributes that set a value always have:
                <ol>
                    <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has
                        one or more attributes).</li>
                    <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
                    <li>The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <h1>Nesting Elements</h1>
                <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that
                    our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a &lt;strong&gt; element, which means that
                    the word is to be strongly emphasized:</p>
                <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                <p>You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. In the example above, we
                    opened the &lt;p&gt; element first, then the &lt;strong&gt; element; therefore, we have to close the
                    &lt;strong&gt; element first, then the &lt;p&gt; element. The following is incorrect:</p>
                <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</code>
                <p>The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one another.
                    If they overlap as shown above, then your web browser will try to make the best guess at what you
                    were trying to say, which can lead to unexpected results. So don't do it!</p>
                <h1>Void Elements</h1>
                <p>Some elements have no content and are called void elements. Take the &lt;img&gt; element that we
                    already have in our HTML page:</p>
                <code>&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" /&gt;</code>
                <p>This contains two attributes, but there is no closing &lt;/img&gt; tag and no inner content. This is
                    because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the
                    HTML page in the place it appears.</p>
                <h1>Anatomy of an HTML document</h1>
                <p>That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't handy on their own. Now we'll
                    look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page. Let's revisit the code we
                    put into our index.html example</p>
                <code>
            <pre>
            &lt;!doctype html&gt;
            &lt;html lang="en-US"&gt;
                &lt;head&gt;
                    &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
                    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" /&gt;
                    &lt;title&gt;My test page&lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;/head&gt;
                &lt;body&gt;
                &lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" /&gt;
                &lt;/body&gt;
            &lt;/html&gt;
            </pre>
            </code>
                <p>Here, we have the following:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</b> — doctype. It is a required preamble. In the mists of time, when
                        HTML was
                        young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page
                        had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other
                        useful things. However, these days, they don't do much and are basically just needed to make
                        sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.</li>
                    <li><b>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</b> — the &lt;html&gt; element. This element wraps all the content
                        on the
                        entire page and is sometimes known as the root element. It also includes the lang attribute,
                        setting the primary language of the document.</li>
                    <li><b>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</b> — the &lt;head&gt; element. This element acts as a container
                        for all
                        the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your
                        page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to
                        appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.</li>
                    <li><b>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</b> — This element sets the character set your document should
                        use to
                        UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially,
                        it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this,
                        and it can help avoid some problems later on.</li>
                    <li><b>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt;</b> — This viewport element ensures
                        the
                        page renders at the width of viewport, preventing mobile browsers from rendering pages wider
                        than the viewport and then shrinking them down.</li>
                    <li><b>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</b> — the &lt;title&gt; element. This sets the title of your
                        page, which
                        is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe
                        the page when you bookmark/favorite it.</li>
                    <li><b>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</b> — the &lt;body&gt; element. This contains all the content that
                        you
                        want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games,
                        playable audio tracks, or whatever else.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

            <header>Images</header>
            <article>
                <p>Let's turn our attention to the &lt;img&gt; element again:</p>
                <code>&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" /&gt;</code>
                <p>As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the
                    src (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file.</p>
                <p>We have also included an alt (alternative) attribute. In the alt attribute, you specify descriptive
                    text for users who cannot see the image, possibly because of the following reasons:
                <ol>
                    <li>They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called
                        screen readers to read out the alt text to them.</li>
                    <li>Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For example, try deliberately
                        changing the path inside your src attribute to make it incorrect. If you save and reload the
                        page, you should see something like this in place of the image:</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <img
                    src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/alt-text-example.png" class="image"><br>
                <p>The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you write should provide the reader
                    with enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys. In this example, our current
                    text of "My test image" is no good at all. A much better alternative for our Firefox logo would be
                    "The Firefox logo: a flaming fox surrounding the Earth."</p>
                <p>Try coming up with some better alt text for your image now.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Marking_up_text">
            <header>Marking up text</header>
            <article>
                <p>This section will cover some essential HTML elements you'll use for marking up the text.</p>
                <h1>Headings</h1>
                <p>Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or
                    subheadings. In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML
                    document can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels, &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;, although you'll commonly
                    only use 3 to 4 at most:</p>
                <code><pre>
                        &lt;!-- 4 heading levels: --&gt;
                        &lt;h1&gt;My main title&lt;/h1&gt;
                        &lt;h2&gt;My top level heading&lt;/h2&gt;
                        &lt;h3&gt;My subheading&lt;/h3&gt;
                        &lt;h4&gt;My sub-subheading&lt;/h4&gt;
                    </pre></code>
                <p id="note"><b>Note:</b> Anything in HTML between &lt;!-- and --&gt; is an HTML comment. The browser
                    ignores
                    comments as it renders the code. In other words, they are not visible on the page - just in the
                    code. HTML comments are a way for you to write helpful notes about your code or logic.</p>
                <p>Now try adding a suitable title to your HTML page just above your &lt;img&gt; element.</p>
                <p id="note"><b>Note:</b> You'll see that your heading level 1 has an implicit style. Don't use heading
                    elements to make text bigger or bold, because they are used for accessibility and other reasons such
                    as SEO. Try to create a meaningful sequence of headings on your pages, without skipping levels.</p>
                <h1>Paragraphs</h1>
                <p>As explained above, &lt;p&gt; elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these
                    frequently when marking up regular text content:</p>
                <p><code>&lt;p&gt;This is a single paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
                <p>Add your sample text into one or a few paragraphs, placed directly below your &lt;img&gt; element.
                </p>
                <h1>Lists</h1>
                <p>A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always
                    consists of at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:
                <ol>
                    <li>Unordered lists are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping
                        list. These are wrapped in a &lt;ul&gt; element.</li>
                    <li>Ordered lists are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These
                        are wrapped in an &lt;ol&gt; element.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p>Each item inside the lists is put inside an &lt;li&gt; (list item) element.</p>
                <p>For example, if we wanted to turn the part of the following paragraph fragment into a list</p>
                <code>
                <pre>
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        At Mozilla, we're a global community of technologists, 
                        thinkers, and builders working together…
                    &lt;/p&gt;
                </pre>
            </code>
                <p>We could modify the markup to this:</p>
                <code>
                <pre>
                    &lt;p&gt;At Mozilla, we're a global community of&lt;/p&gt;
                        
                    &lt;ul&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;technologists&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;thinkers&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;builders&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;/ul&gt;
                        
                    &lt;p&gt;working together…&lt;/p&gt;
                </pre>
            </code>
                <p>Try adding an ordered or unordered list to your example page.</p>

            <article>
                <p>Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a simple
                    element — &lt;a&gt; — "a" being the short form for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into
                    a link, follow these steps:</p>
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".</li>
                    <li>Wrap the text in an &lt;a&gt; element, as shown
                        below:<br><code>&lt;a&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code></li>
                    <li>Give the <a> element an href attribute, as shown
                            below:<br><code>&lt;a href=""&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code></li>
                    <li>Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link
                        to:<br><code>&lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/"&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p>You might get unexpected results if you omit the https:// or http:// part, called the protocol, at
                    the beginning of the web address. After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where
                    you wanted it to.</p>
                <p id="note"><b>Note:</b> href might appear like a rather obscure choice for an attribute name at first.
                    If you
                    are having trouble remembering it, remember that it stands for hypertext reference.</p>
